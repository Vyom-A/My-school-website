<h1>About us</h1> 

<p>Jai Academy was established in 2002 to perpetuate the memory of Late Shri Jai Chandra Arya, the great pillar on which the foundation of the present Jagran Group family stands. "Dainik Jagran” was first conceptualised in 1942 in the historic city of Jhansi. It is the most circulated newspaper in India and 17th most read newspaper in the world. Late Shri Arya was an eminent philanthropist and therefore, to make his dreams come true, “Dainik Jagran” on it’s Platinum Jubilee, dedicated this school to its birth place, Jhansi,  in the hopes that it will be an institution which becomes the epitome of humanitarian values and high educational standards.
Jai Academy marks the opening of a new era in Jhansi for school education. It is not just another school, it is a “School with a difference”. In tune with the reputation of its promoters, the school holds an assurance for providing educational facilities of the highest order and also ensures development in the field of academics, co-curricular activities and character building of the children entrusted to it. The institution has made rapid strides and now occupies a place of pride in this historic city.
Jai Academy is co-educational and the medium of instruction is English. Within a year of its inception, the school was affiliated with the Central Board of Secondary Education, New Delhi . Since the inception of the school in April 2002, the total number of students has grown from 58 to 4000 and the teaching faculty is of 200 Staff Members. We pride ourselves in producing young adults who have social awareness and leadership qualities.</p>

<p>My school has created better practical labs in covid for classes 11-12 so that they can do their experiments easily without any confusion and without any shortage of instruments. The practical lab has better instruments as the microscopes can see at more magnificant level . There are more acids and more chemicals available there so that we can do all experiments which we want . They also have more safety as there are good gloves which do not get teared or get melted on the fall of acid , good spectacles which do not allow acid to infect our eyes . </p>
